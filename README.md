To run the code:

- Pull from master and open the project in Unity 2018.3.9f1. Different versions cause merge conflicts and do not work, since most assets become magenta and scripts become null.

- The scene used in the project is contained solely in titanicroom.unity, 

The Design branch contains changes such as new materials, assets and textures, and is merged to master from time to time. 

The branch door_open is an experimental branch to test door opening interactions for the first puzzle in the room, and should not be merged to master.

Most interactions such as throwing and teleporting use the SteamVR plugin from Unity Asset Store.
